Code for the paper "Distributed-Training-and-Execution Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Power Control in HetNet"
Please run the corresponding "main_..." files to generate the results in the paper.
You may need to modify the code according to the hyperparameters given in the paper.
I will update the code so that it will be more readable when I have spare time in the future.
Please feel free to contact me via k.xu21@imperial.ac.uk, if you have questions regarding the code or the paper. I will try to reply to per your request.
